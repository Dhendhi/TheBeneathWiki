## Profile

The King of Monestro, and Lord of House Alphonzo 

An excerpt from the Monestro Library:

> [!attention] To all Residing in Monestro
> King Valequill Monestro, was known throughout the land for his wisdom, strength, and benevolence. He had ruled over the kingdom for many years, guiding his people with a fair and just hand. Under his rule, Monestro prospered and flourished, becoming a beacon of light in a dark and uncertain world. King Valequill was beloved by his subjects, who admired his courage and integrity. But despite his power and influence, King Valequill remained humble and kind-hearted. He was known to personally visit the villages and towns of his kingdom, listening to the concerns of his people and offering help wherever he could.
> 
> His reign was not without challenges, however. Enemies from [[Elexamora]] sought to overthrow him and claim Monestro for themselves. But King Valequill stood firm against these threats, rallying his armies to defend their homeland with unwavering determination. In the end, King Valequill's courage and leadership prevailed, securing peace and prosperity for Monestro for generations to come. And so he was remembered as one of the greatest rulers in the history of the kingdom.

> Long live King Valequill Monestro, the noble leader of House Alphonzo!
