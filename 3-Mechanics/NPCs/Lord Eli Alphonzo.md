## Profile

Lord Eli is the son of [[King Valequill Monestro]], known to be the more informal younger version of their father. When Eli was an early child his mother Queen Alfie Monestro was struck by a terrible illness, leaving both father and son without a wife and mother. As a result while Eli is still favored for the throne, he is otherwise unfavored by his father the King.

Not typically in court, the dealing of Lord Eli Alphonzo are unknown to most. The only chance to sighting the little prince would be to attend the Day of Liberation in the courts of Monestro, however most haven't a chance to attending such a prestigious event. However there are writings of Lord Eli in the Monestro library where you can learn of his tragedy.

> [!warning]+ An excerpt of an unknown play.
> Once upon a time, in the grand kingdom of Monestro, there lived a King named Valequill and his beloved wife, Queen Alfie. They were known throughout the land for their kindness and wisdom. After many years of marriage, Queen Alfie gave birth to a son, whom they named Eli. The kingdom rejoiced at the arrival of the heir to the throne, but their happiness was short-lived. Tragedy struck when Queen Alfie fell ill with a mysterious illness shortly after giving birth.
> 
> Despite the best efforts of the royal physicians, Queen Alfie's condition only worsened with each passing day. The King was devastated as he watched his beloved wife grow weaker and weaker. In her final moments, Queen Alfie made her husband promise to always protect and care for their son, Eli. Heartbroken and grief-stricken, King Valequill fulfilled his promise to his dying wife. He raised young Eli with love and devotion, but he could never quite shake off the sorrow that had settled in his heart since losing his wife.
> 
> As Eli grew older, it became clear that he possessed all the qualities of a true leader â€“ intelligence, courage, and compassion. The people of Alphonzo admired him for his strength and humility, much like they had admired his parents before him.
