## Overview
The once great clan of Bonaventure was well known in [[Kurogh Port]] for being the most fair and vigil pirate clan on the Sparkling Domain. Clan [[Cobalt]] was not a fan of their success and sought to take it out on them by becoming a privateer clan and eradicating them in the "Battle of Skulled Ships".

## Etymology
The Bonaventure creed is "Vaghiamo. recintaimo, moriamo" meaning "We wander, we fence, we die."
- Their flag represents this creed: the legs to wander, the sabers to fence, the skull to die.

As of the current age, the Bonaventure clan is considered to be completely gone due to the "Battle of Skulled Ships"
In the past, the Bonaventure clan was known for their brazen attacks of [[Elexamora|Elexamoran]], [[Monestro|Monstrian]], and [[Mopria|Moprian]] ships. 
They also were known their acts of bravery when faced with dangerous challenges, such as actions taken during the "Battle of Skulled Ships".
