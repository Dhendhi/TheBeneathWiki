# `=this.file.name`

## Overview

The ruling house of the city-state Monestro. Led by King Valequill Monestro, they are the royal Lords and Ladies which run the castle-city of Monestro with an iron fist akin to their house banner. Lord Eli Alphonzo is the heir to the house and throne of Monestro.

Their house banner is a white gauntlet in an upwards fist, the dorsal side embossed with a crown. The fist is in front of a yellow book, tying back to their connections to the Order. All of this is in front of a blue background with a green trim and golden border, their house colors.

## Etymology

Alphonzo was the name a certain group on workers had long ago under the rule of The Beneath. They operated out of what is currently Monestro, and once the people were liberated helped found the royal houses and create the castle city that rules today. Not much is known for the origins of the name Alphonzo, as it had been lost to time and the rule of The Beneath.
