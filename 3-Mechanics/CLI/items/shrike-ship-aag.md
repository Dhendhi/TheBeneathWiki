# Shrike Ship
*Spelljammer, Vehicle (space)*  

- **Cost**: 20,000 gp
- **Weight**: ⏤

This swift vessel is a relatively recent design, quickly gaining popularity with merchants and pirates. A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.

Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistae—one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram.
