# Guild Keyrune
*Wondrous Item, varies (requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Associated with a particular guild, a guild keyrune is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.
