# Additional Spelljammer Tables
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide* 

## Shipboard Tasks

During the uneventful part of a voyage, the captain of a spelljamming ship can put crew members to work in several ways. If a character is looking for a job to do, or if a captain wants to keep a character busy, roll on the Shipboard Tasks table to determine what needs to be done. The time it takes to complete a task is at least 1 hour, and certain tasks might take longer at your discretion.

## Ship Quirks

Roll on the Ship Quirks table if you want to add a bit of "personality" to a ship.

## Ship Cargo

To randomly determine what's in the cargo hold of a spelljamming ship, roll `1d6` times on the Cheap Cargo table and `1d4`â€“1 times on the Expensive Cargo table. A duplicate result indicates that the ship has more of the same cargo.

If a cargo container is locked, at least one crew member (typically the captain) has the key to it. A character can try to unlock a container using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
