In the deep dark chasms of the realm, giants slumber awaiting the fortold return of Vaethero - Keeper of the Beneath

600 years before today, during the age of darkness, Vaethero and their Empire controlled the realm from The Beneath. The surface dwellers were slaves to their empire, growing food and mining out new chasms at the cost of their lives. The fey, gnomes, orcs, dwarves, and the giants banded together under the soil for their own gain.

But one fateful day, five wizards of the colors banded together to vanquish The Beneath. Their combined power was enough to put them to slumber, and seal them into a tomb of their own making. The people rejoiced, their sovereignty restored and the future looking bright they formed a society from the remains of The Beneath's grasp.

Now, 500 years after the sealing of the maws, terror has struck the world once again. The clanging of hammer on steel is heard from below. The forges have awoken and it shan't be long till The Beneath reclaims their lost grasp. The Five Wizards of the Colors are disparate, lost or forgotten. Who will save the surface?
