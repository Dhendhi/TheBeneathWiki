## Overview
The largest castle city of the world, Monestro has long ties dating back to the days of the Beneath, a fact that is lost upon most of it's people. While their control of information has inspired the rest of the world, most countries have not even come close to their economic or military might. Mostly home to the Humans, but all manner of species roam these streets.

## Story

###### Uprising of the Chosen
* A fourth royal house used to exist, but was eradicated during the Uprising of the Chosen, as the Order sent a chosen family to destroy the old Royal family.

## Internal Relationships

###### House Alphonzo
- Currently holding the title of Monestro with King Valequill Monestro. His son, Lord Eli Alphonzo is the current heir to the throne both as the head of house Alphonzo and as the Monestro. Brutal from the moment they controlled the crown, they despise the poor and detest those that do not follow the Order of the Aenocyon Dirus.

###### House Voresia 
- The weakest of the three houses, constantly under threat of extinction by the combined efforts of House Ceres and Alphonzo. They act as the reform faction for the kingdom. Sides with the people, and thus is protected by the people. Funds the revolution against the Order of the Aenocyon Dirus.

###### House Ceres
- The lackeys of House Alphonzo, and the faction that controls the military. They are just as happy to kill children as they are the starve the people for any benefit they can get. They hope to gain control over the throne via servitude to the current heirs. Minor positions in court, but they are the brawn of Monestro.

## Outward Relationships

Hated by the inhabitants of [[Elexamora]].
Many major trade routes start from Monestro and end at Monestro. Many say that the world's economy relies solely on Monestro's might.
