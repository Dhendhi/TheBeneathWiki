# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
While technically still a part of Mopria, Kurogh Port is a hub of villainy and piracy (much to the lament of many Moprian Senators). It is home to the famous "Hundred Mile" port, which makes it a central part of the Aecreon commerce. Ruler-less and wild, the port is only for the most hearty of folk, or the best connected.

## Notable NPCs

#### High Captain Corliss "Betrayer" Cobalt
They are the high captain of Clan Cobalt,  the one who signed off on the *Battle of Skulled Ships* which forever desecrated the name Cobalt in all circles of banditry. He sails on the ship *"Dishonorable Pirate"* with his crew *"The Skulled".*

#### Captain Emilia "Betrayer" Cobalt 
They are another captain who served in the *"Battle of Skulled Ships"* with the most sunken ships in the entire battle (16 sunken ships overnight). She sails on the ship *"Devil's Jewel"* with her feared crew *"The Black Bandannas"*.

#### Shipmate Joss Cobalt 
The only pirate who didn't participate in the *"Battle of Skulled Ships"* as he did not approve the fact that they were betraying their brothers in banditry. His whereabouts are unknown but highly sought after from both the [[Cobalt]] and Bonaventure clan supporters.
