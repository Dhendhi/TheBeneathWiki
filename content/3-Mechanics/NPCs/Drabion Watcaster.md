## Profile
Drabion Watcaster, the Head of House Watcaster is a very rich individual. This is plain to see when you look at their clothing, only wearing the finest silk of [[Sterix]] and the finest jewels of [[Shiugath]]. They are the leader of the tieflings in Elexamora, and have a bitter rivalry with the [[Cast of Stelos]]. The only thing that unites the two are their hatred for [[Monestro]].

Drabion is a very private man and will avoid telling anyone anything about their family. Thus not much is really known about the man behind the wealth or their family.
