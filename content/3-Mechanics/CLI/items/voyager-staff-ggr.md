# Voyager Staff
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [banishment](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/banishment.md) (4 charges), [blink](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blink.md) (3 charges), [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md) (2 charges), [passwall](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md) (5 charges), or [teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md) (7 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.
